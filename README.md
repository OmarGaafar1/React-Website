# React-Website

## Description 
Our project began with designing a user-friendly reservation platform using Figma's prototypes and wireframes. Through React development, we built the platform from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a dynamic and responsive experience. By integrating APIs, we achieved real-time updates for available booking time slots, preventing double bookings. This project seamlessly merges design, development, and data integration to redefine dining reservations, showcasing our commitment to innovation and user-centric solutions. From concept to execution, our platform transforms the way users engage with restaurant bookings.
